# Sawagu: post RSS headlines and links to Twitter

Because I wanted to automatically tweet links to my blog using my personalized
URL shortener (rather than whatever Feedburner sticks me with).

The word "[sawagu][defn]" is Japanese for "to make noise; to make racket; to be noisy"
or "to make a fuss", which seems about right for this purpose.
